<h1>Toxic Chemical by Plastic</h1>
</section>
 
  <div class="main">
<section class="carousel">
<h3>Plastics are made with many chemical additives to improve their strength, flexibility, color, and resistance to heat or sunlight. However, some of these chemicals can be harmful to our health and the environment. One well-known example is BPA (Bisphenol A), which is often used in plastic bottles and food containers. BPA can sometimes leak into food or drinks, especially when the plastic is heated or scratched.It is estimated that by 2050, around 2 billion tonnes of chemical additives will have been used in plastics. This shows how important it is to reduce plastic use and find safer, more eco-friendly alternatives.</h3>

<h1>Plastic Waste</h1>
</section>
 
  <div class="main">
<section class="carousel">
<h3>Plastic waste means plastic objects which have not been recycled or disposed properly, or have been illegally dumped.Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world's oceans, rivers, and lakes. Plastic pollution is a global problem. Every year 19-23 million tonnes of plastic waste leaks into aquatic ecosystems, polluting lakes, rivers and seas.</h3>

<h1>What Are Microplastics?</h1>
</section>
 
  <div class="main">
<section class="carousel">
<h3>Microplastics are extremely small plastic fragments less than 5 millimeters in size that can be found everywhere, from the deep ocean to the air we breathe. They pose a serious threat to the environment, wildlife, and human health. These tiny plastics are often eaten by fish, birds, and marine animals, causing injury or even death. People also consume microplastics through food, water, and air, which may lead to health problems.</h3>

<h1>How Do Microplastics Enter Our Bodies?</h1>
</section>
 
  <div class="main">
<section class="carousel">
<h3>Humans unknowingly ingest and inhale microplastics from various sources in their daily lives. These tiny plastic particles can be found in contaminated seafood like fish and shellfish, as well as in both tap and bottled water. Even everyday items such as table salt and beverages like beer can contain microplastics. In fact, studies estimate that an adult may consume up to 2,000 microplastic particles per year from salt alone. Additionally, microplastics are present in the air we breathe, especially in indoor environments, making it nearly impossible to avoid exposure entirely.

      <h1>How Do We Reduce and Recycle Microplastics?</h1>
      <p>Recycle properly and reduce plastic use, use natural fiber clothing (like cotton), bring reusable bags and bottles, avoid products with microbeads, use filters on washing machines (to trap microfibers), and support plastic bans and cleanup projects.</p>

      <h1>Affect on our Health</h1>
      <p>Microplastics are dangerous because they can seriously harm both the environment and human health. In nature, these tiny plastic particles are often mistaken for food by fish, birds, and other animals, leading to internal injuries, blockages, or even death. They also pollute ecosystems and disrupt the food chain. For humans, microplastics enter our bodies through food, water, and even the air we breathe.</p>

      <h1>Types of Microplastic</h1>
      <p>Some microplastics are made to be small on purpose, like the tiny beads used in some beauty products and cleaning items these are called primary microplastics. They get into the environment when we use and throw away those products. Other microplastics come from bigger plastic items breaking down over time, like plastic bags, bottles, or fishing gear that slowly fall apart because of sunlight, waves, or wear and tear these are called secondary microplastics. </p>
